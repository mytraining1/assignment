Agile SDLC planning and Estimation:-
--------------------------------------
   Agile planning and estimation is the critical component 
   of software develoment.

  the below is the list of steps for planning and estimation.

1. product backlog refinement:-
--------------------------------
   -> the product owner colloborate with stackholder to refine the 
    product backlog, ensure that list of feature should be prioritize.

  -> the team reviews and discuss the each backlog item.for more
  clarification.

2. sprint planning metting:-
----------------------------
   -> the team selects a certains items from the product backlog.
      select the core iteam to develope first, considering the 
      complexity, market needs. 

   -> the selected backlog item that is converted into a task, and 
     the task shoule be implemented as product feature.

3. story point estimation:-
----------------------------
    ->  how much the complexity is involved based on that, 
      based on that the estimated duration is assigned to the 
      particular task. 
        (to write a particular userstory how much time it may take)
        eg:-
        ----
           write a userstory for login.  (1 hr)
           write a userstory for booking. (4 hr)

4.task estimation:
-------------------- 
    -> to complete the give user story as a product feature.
       ->no number developer, 
       -> task complexity,
       -> project depedencies (any external api, license needed).

5.sprint goal:-
----------------
   ->every member of team should be aware of spring goal.
     the team should be aware of sprint outcome.

       eg:-
       ----
         loan feature to be released.  
      
================================================================
 effective daily standup:-
 -------------------------
   
 step1:- set the meeting context.
 step2:- desired meeting time and location. 
           eg:-
           ---- 
              10 am  --> daily
              online and offline options
     
            
step3:-[on the day of meeting],
      ->scrum master/ manager will welcome every, 
      and inform team member to update the status.

step 4:- each team memeber has to tell his status in same format.
        3 question..?

        what we did yestarday..?
        what we will do today..?
        Is any thing blocking..?

        keep the update short and clear.

step 5:- all the team memeber should have a chance to update their

step 6:- start and end time should be followed. 
         meeting should not be extended.

step 7:-listen to team memeber status,
===============================================================
people involved in daily standup meeting:-
-------------------------------------------
1.developer team:-
 -----------------
   designer, developer, tester, who are involved in the project 
   they will be joining the meeting. to give their status.

2.scrum master:-
-----------------
   -> he guides the team. 
   -> motivate the team to follow agile practice.
   -> scrum master ensure that, the team member status are up to 
      date.


3. product owner:-
------------------
    -> when there is a need product owner will join the standup call.
     for clarification of the requirement.

4.stackholder(optional):-
--------------------------  
   -> very rarely manager  join the stand up meeting.
   -> to address the challenges / issues manager will join the call.

=================================================
responsiblity of scrum master:-
-------------------------------
1. guide the team. (mentor / choice)
2. motive team to follow agile practice.
3. identify the issues, and provide necessary solution.
4. ensure team colloboration, 
5. ensure team status up to date.
6. protect the team. 
7. team improvement. (upgrade new skills, improve in performance).
======================================================
effective communication during testing phase:-
-----------------------------------------------
steps:-
--------
1. pre-testing communication planning:-
        -> before the actual testing start, stackholder tells 
        expectations. what is the outcome of testing.

2.Test plan Review Metting:-
    -> what are the difference types of testing is involved.
    -> here develoment team, testing team and product owner is 
    involved.
     how the approach of testing for a particular functionality.

3. Setup for Defect Tracking system. 
     eg:-
     ---- 
       jira 
       trello
       ....etc...     
      during testing, if any issue occurs in the functinality,
      it need to be reported to developer, through any tool jira or trello.

     manager/ product owner / scrum master and other team member 
     can able to see the issue which are raised in testing phase 
     in jira/trello.

     jira/trello:-
     --------------
        It is a central issue tracking, all the issues are resolved
        issue , pending are can be clearly visible in the tool.

4.Test Result report documentation.
     after testing , then maintain a report for the test passed 
     and test failed.

     after testing , time to time report need to be update.

5. Defect Triger Metting:-  
    list out all the defects , prioritize the defects and try to 
    fix the issues,and  action plan to fix the issue.

    (types of testing will done)
    unit testing
    functinality testing
    system testing 
    integration testing

6. User acceptance testing.
    colloborate closely with the end user, do all the acceptance
    testing.

     Acceptance Testing is the last phase of software testing 
     performed after System Testing and before making the 
     system available for actual use.
      
      developer, tester, product owner are involved in defect team.

===============================================================
Deployment and release:-
------------------------
release phase:-
-------------- 
    in release phase invovles,
             packaging, (pack all the classes into one )
             managing, (provide run time dependency)
             and deploy release across different environment.
                
             development environment [development server]
             testing environment    [testing server]
             production environment  [production server]


           production server:-
           ------------------ 
               when we push the code production server, then 
               it is live for the end user.

              develoment server (daily all the developer task are 
                 |              pushed to development server)
                 |
              testing server   (after completing the functinality,
                 |            the, it is pushed to testing server)
                 |
              production server  (if every thing is tested and works
                                  then it will move to production)  
                                 where it will be live for the customer.

Post - Deployment:-
-------------------------
1. operate phase:-
 ----------------
   It is nothing but, use of software by the end user in the 
   production environment.

2.mointer / maintanace phase:-
------------------------------
    here the software is monitored, which include 
        1. system performance.
        2. user experience.
        3. there should be a is support team, to manage the issue.
